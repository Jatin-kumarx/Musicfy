# React Project Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to clone the repository and run the React project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)
  - You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/)
  
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **yarn** (alternative package manager)
  - npm comes pre-installed with Node.js. You can install Yarn from [here](https://yarnpkg.com/).

## 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine.

1. Open your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows).
2. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jatin-kumarx/Musicfy.git
## 2. Install Dependencies
Once you've cloned the repository and navigated into the project folder, you need to install the necessary dependencies.

 If you're using npm:

    npm install

Or, if you're using Yarn:

    yarn install

This will install all the packages and dependencies defined in the package.json file.

## 3. Run the Development Server
After the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server to start the React project.

1. To run the development server, use the following command:

For npm:

    npm run dev

For Yarn:

    yarn run dev

This will start the server and open the React application in your default web browser.
